Coding Assessment Reflection:
If I had more time, I would create a better user experience and fix the comments in my code.
I recently completed a ConnectFour assignment, so I felt prepared to tackle the prompt.
I began by building a basic tic-tac-toe with player and miniboard classes. I then implemented the 'bigBoard' class.
I struggled with the string representation of the metaboard. I also did not have time to fully test my implementation. 
At the end of two hours, I had issues with the string representation of the metaboard,
and the placement of the checker in each individual board, as it would sometimes duplicate into other boards.
Overall, I feel that if I had another 30 minutes I could clean up the functionality of the program to make it 
fully functional and readable. I am satisfied with the foundation of the program.
